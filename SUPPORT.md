# Support Policy

KAI Scheduler follows a structured release lifecycle to ensure stability for production environments.

## Release Schedule & LTS Policy

Starting with **v0.12**, we adopt the following release cadence:

* **Standard Versions (Odd numbers, e.g., v0.13):** Feature releases supported only until the next version is released.
* **LTS Versions (Even numbers, e.g., v0.12):** Long Term Support versions.

### Support Duration
**LTS Versions** are supported publicly for **1 Year** from their release date. During this window, they receive:
* Security Patches (CVEs)
* Critical Bug Fixes

## Support Matrix

The following versions are currently supported.

| Version | Type | Release Date | End of Support | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
